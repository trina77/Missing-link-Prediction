# Missing-Link-Prediction-In-Ecological-Environments
The project focuses on optimizing ML methods to handle the complexity and  sparsity of ecological data.
### Project Brief: Network Analysis and Link Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing a network dataset to understand relationships between different entities and predict potential missing links using various machine learning and graph-based techniques. The dataset contains interactions between `VISSP_CODE` and `PLTSP_CODE`, which are analyzed to uncover patterns, community structures, and potential future interactions.

Key Features:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load and clean the dataset by handling missing values.
   - Extract and analyze unique values in `VISSP_CODE` and `PLTSP_CODE`.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - Build directed and undirected graphs using `networkx` to represent interactions between `VISSP_CODE` and `PLTSP_CODE`.
   - Visualize the graphs to understand the structure and relationships.

3. **Centrality Measures**:
   - Calculate various centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, and k-core) to identify the most influential nodes in the network.

4. **Community Detection**:
   - Use greedy modularity to detect communities within the network.
   - Visualize the detected communities.

5. **Link Prediction**:
   - Implement collaborative filtering using cosine similarity to predict missing links.
   - Use Node2Vec to generate node embeddings and predict links based on cosine similarity of embeddings.
   - Apply Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) for link prediction.
   - Implement an Autoencoder to reconstruct the interaction matrix and identify potential missing links.

6. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Evaluate the performance of link prediction models using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

7. **Visualization**:
   - Generate heatmaps to visualize interaction patterns.
   - Plot bipartite graphs for each `PLOT_ID` to understand the distribution of interactions.

#### Tools and Libraries:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NetworkX**: Graph construction and analysis.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
- **Node2Vec**: Node embedding generation.
- **LightFM**: Bayesian Personalized Ranking for link prediction.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Autoencoder implementation for link prediction.

#### Applications:
- **Recommendation Systems**: Predict potential interactions or collaborations.
- **Social Network Analysis**: Identify key influencers and community structures.
- **Biological Networks**: Analyze protein-protein interactions or gene regulatory networks.

#### Repository Structure:
- **Data**: Contains the dataset (`SA02601_v6_new.csv`).
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with the code for data preprocessing, graph analysis, and link prediction.
- **Results**: Output files, including predicted links and visualizations.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions for running the code.

#### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to preprocess the data, analyze the network, and predict missing links.

This project provides a comprehensive approach to network analysis and link prediction, leveraging both traditional graph-based methods and modern machine learning techniques.
